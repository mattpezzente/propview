# Portfolio V - React Property Viewer

## Overview
Property Viewer is an application that runs completely on the client-side, being powered by React JS. It was made as a demonstration of my ability to implement React JS to create a small, yet dynamic, application, using purely client-side code (JS, SASS, etc.).

The application itself, is a property viewing utility, that is designed to take in a property address, and return results and listing information based on the address given. It also implements a GPS feature, that gets the user's current location, and displays information of the address he/she is currently at.
